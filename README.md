# Relationship-Between-Lipophilicity-and-Molecular-Weight
This project analyzes pharmaceutical compounds from Manapharmadb.csv, focusing on molecular properties that influence drug development. The analysis uses pandas for data handling and matplotlib for visualization to explore relationships between molecular weight and lipophilicity (XLogP).
